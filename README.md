Over the span of 1996 to 2023, the NBA underwent a dynamic transformation both on and off the court. This era witnessed a shift in playing styles towards a faster pace, emphasizing three-point shooting and versatility among players.  The league's global reach expanded significantly with the rise of international players, while technological advancements in analytics and sports science revolutionized player development and performance analysis. Financially, the NBA experienced substantial growth driven by lucrative media deals and increased fan engagement through digital platforms and social media. These changes, alongside shifts in player movement and team compositions, set the stage for an analysis of how player attributes and performance metrics evolved over time in response to these transformative trends.This data was pulled from a Kaggle Dataset which had no need to be cleaned as all the data had necessary statistics to generate columns, so no values had to be dropped, or changed. From looking at, and understanding the data, it can be easily understood that the 3-point line, has caused major changes in point amounts in the NBA, and other factors seem to stagnate over the 27 years of data presented.
