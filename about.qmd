My name is Lowell Ethan, I'm a rising junior at Oakdale High. I like to play basketball, make music, and am passionate about computer/data science.

## The Project

This project is to visualize, and better understand the NBA from 1996-2023. The key goals are to see how statistics and strategy changed over the 27 years of data collected on each player.

This project was created as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
